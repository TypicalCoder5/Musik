I've been working on this project for quite a while and I think it is ready to release to the public!
Report any bugs to me on GitHub comments and don't be disrespectful, This is my first discord bot.

If you know how to add bots to discord the complicated way, go ahead and download this
but I don't know how to do this a complicated way all I did was write the code.

But anyways,

Instructions:
Use ?help for commands
Use ?play to play music
Use ?stop to stop music

NOTE: This only supports YouTube due to not anything in the code having anything to do with soundcloud or spotify.

But anyways, enjoy!
